# A analysis of Kickstarter trends

## Overview of Project
This was a project to analyze some trends among Kickstarter projects for Louise, a client who is interested in crowdfunding a stage play. Kickstarter data was collected, filtered, and analyzed to assist in the planning of Louise's Kickstarter campaign.
### Purpose
To help Louise plan the financial goals and timing of her Kickstarter campaign by analyzing the effect of a project's launch date and financial goals has on the project's success rate.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
As shown in the graph below, the number of successful Kickstarter cmpaigns in the Theater category were at their greatest when started in the summer months, with the highest number of successes in May. They were least successful in the winter months, with the lowest number of successes in December. Notably, the number of successful campaigns varies a lot more by month than the number of failed campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
As shown in the graph below, the success rate of Kickstarter campaigns in the Theater category decreases as the goal amount gets larger until the goal bracket of $30000 to $34999 is reached, where it increases until the goal bracket of $45000 to $44999, where it drops to zero, and remains below 20% at $50000 and above. It should be noted, however, that the sample sizes involved are much smaller in those brackets of larger financial goals. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The biggest challenge was in getting the Outcomes Based on Goal Amount chart to display correctly. Fixing the formatting of the table data to percentage and switching the row and column in Excel's Select Data Source window fixed that problem. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Kickstarter campaigns in the Theater category are most successful when begun in the early summer months, especially in May. If possible, Louise should plan the start of her campaign accordingly.

Kickstarter campaigns in the Theater category are least suz=ccessful in the winter months, especially in December. If Louise cannot begin her campaign in the summer, she should at least do what she can to avoid starting it in the winter.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Kickstarter campaigns in the Theater category are more successful the lower their financial goals are set, and Louise should set a goal as low as she can reasonably afford.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

This data set doesn't take place over a very long time period, and the popularity of crowdfunding, and particularly of Kickstarter itself, has changed a lot over that short time period. It is difficult to know in such a new and volatile space how much past trends are predictive of the future.

This data also doesn't differentiate between projects by first-time artists and established artists who have previously run successful Kickstarter campaigns. It's possible that the potential project backers will trust Louise less because she is a first time creator, and relying on a pool of data that includes a mix of established and unestablished creators won't yield the best results.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
The Theater Outcomes by Month of the Year graph shows the nnumber of successful projects and the number of failed projects, but it does not explicitly show the percentage rate at which projects succeed by month. Looking at the graph, it seems that the number of successful projects changes more than the nummber of failed projects by month, and so displaying the percentage of success by month might make the difference between the best and worst months even more stark.

The Outcomes Based on Goal Amount does not show the sample size of projects contained in each bracket. Although it appears that there is a resurgence in the success rate in the $35000 to $39999 and the $40000 to $44999 brackets, those brackets only contain 6 projects and 3 projects respectively. A line graph that breaks down the number of projects by the same goal brackets would make it clear that the sample sizes for the smaller goals are much larger and therefore likely to be more reliable.
